   - Spot sizes: Various optical couplers available
   - Frequency: 3-10 Hz adjustable
   - Energy: 2-12 Joules for rejuvenation, higher for hair removal

2. Tri-Pulse Q-Switched Laser
   - Wavelengths: 1064nm (black/blue/green pigments), 532nm (red pigments)
   - Applications: Tattoo removal, pigment removal (age spots, ota's nevus, zygomatic spots, CALMS)
   - Energy ranges: 200-400mj depending on treatment
   - Spot sizes: 3-7mm
   - Frequency: 5-10 Hz

COMMON TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES:

VADER 808:
- Unit won't start: Check emergency stop button, verify power plug, check key switch position
- Error codes on screen: Check water flow/coolant level, verify foot switch connection
- Temperature too high (>35°C): Turn off until temp reaches 30°C
- Temperature too low (<10°C): Raise room temperature
- Foot switch not working: Reconnect and enable in settings
- Water alarm ("Di, Di, Di" sound): Add distilled water through vent port
- Handpiece not operating: Check connection, enable in settings

Tri-Pulse Q-Switched:
- Machine won't start: Ensure cooling water tank is full, check all connections
- Overflow hole must have CPC connector when running
- Change cooling water every 2 months, cycle coolant for 2 minutes weekly
- Verify articulated arm is properly installed
- Check safety goggles are appropriate wavelength (OD ≥5 @ 532nm)

OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES:

VADER 808 Hair Removal:
- Start at 3 Joules for first-time clients
- Look for erythema, perifollicular edema as tissue response
- Adjust 2-5J at a time based on client comfort
- Use 3-10 Hz based on treatment area size
- Two passes with 50% overlap (N,S,E,W pattern)
- Laser won't enable without optical coupler installed

Tri-Pulse Treatments:
- Always test at low energy first (3-5 shots)
- Hold treatment tip at 90° to skin
- Overlap spots by 1/3
- Stop when light erythema appears or slight blood oozing occurs
- For cloasma: 1064nm, 300mj starting, 5-10Hz
- For zygomatic spots: 1064nm, 260mj starting, 4mm spot
- For nevus of Ota: 1064nm, 400mj quick scan, then 250mj with 3mm spot

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Class 4 laser - controlled area required
- Appropriate wavelength-specific safety goggles mandatory
- No reflective materials in treatment room
- Treatment area must be dry (no alcohol)
- Proper skin preparation and consultation required
- Document all treatments with photos

MAINTENANCE:
- Clean optical couplers with anhydrous alcohol or acetone using lint-free lens tissue
- Never touch optics with bare hands
- Change VADER coolant water annually, check level every 2 weeks
- Store optics in clean, protected containers
- Cycle Tri-Pulse coolant weekly for 2 minutes
